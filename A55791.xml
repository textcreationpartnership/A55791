            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the CITY.</head>
            <p>GOD was pleaſed to make you glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of our liberty in the laſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> account it your ſhame good men your glory: <hi>They</hi> for this cauſe hate you, and ſeek to divide you; <hi>Theſe</hi> care for you, and endeavour to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite you: <hi>They</hi> endeavour to draw you to themſelves, not that they love you, but that they may make good their aims by weakning you: <hi>Theſe</hi> endeavour to ſet you upright for no other ends but your own ſafety, as knowing how dangerous your Avulſion were from the Common-weal. <hi>They</hi> can never love you, remembring how their Cauſe hath ſuffered by you: <hi>Theſe</hi> will ever cleave to you be your ſelves never ſo unwilling, as knowing how advantagious to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like you have been and may be. The way to continue you glorious, is to continue your old intereſts, and not ſeeking new ones, which will ever lead you into new precipices: If you mean to enjoy the fruits of your hazards and expences, ſtick to your former Cauſe, and become not rennagadoes to your noble profeſſions and adventures. If you do, I do not now admoniſh, but propheſie, your faces will be covered with ſhame, and your mouths filled with gravell, and thoſe means which carnall wiſdom may ſuggeſt to you, as the fitteſt for your ſecurity, will in despight of your policy, prove the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and fatall cauſes of your devaſtation: It grieves me
<pb facs="tcp:37183:3"/> to think how forward you are in theſe forbidden paths: yee harbour Snakes in your boſoms; an especiall antidote that may hinder the poyſon to come at your heart is more then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: God hath hindered many of your motions; if you go on, there may one be connived at, and then take heed, leaſt you gather the judgements of other Countries (as you have their people already,) contracted into your boſoms.</p>
            <p>Ye have yet wiſe Governours among you, follow them, and be adviſed by them; remember how like fathers they were to you when you laſt ſtirred at <hi>Guildhall;</hi> remember their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is yours, they cannot undo you and preſerve themſelves: Hate all thoſe murmurers that diſtill poyſon in your ears, and provoke you to diſcontent; your ſelves may hereafter confeſſe that this advice was faithfull. Grudge not at the Army, though they may be a little burdenſome: That handfull of men (know it) ſtands between you and oppreſſion; had that bank been pulled down, thoſe waters which have lately over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed ſome pieces of our Land, had broke in upon you, and overborne you.</p>
            <p>This addreſſe proceeds from my well-wiſhes; if prejudice will ſuffer you to peruſe it, you, and the whole Kingdom (to whom it will not be unſeaſonable) may draw from it ſome uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full concluſions, the God of union prosper it unto you, and continue you firme to your firſt love, leaſt you ſlide into a ſhamefull and miſerable Apoſtacy, which ever doubles the crime in a Malefactor. Adieu.</p>

            <head>A PARALEL between the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of this preſent KING and PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p n="1">§. I. AMong the many cauſes which have cheriſhed and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our late and preſent diſtempers, there is none have been more powerfull then the audacious liberty, and careleſſe permiſſion of printed Pamphlets, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiderable, have better familiarity with the vulgar, and being fraught with reaſons fit for their capacity, do not onely confirm thoſe malignant whom they finde ſo; but by their tart aſperſions laid on the beſt Perſons, and their bold miſinterpretations put upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt actions, corrupt and poyſon many times the beſt and pureſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grities; while they of the adverſe Party laugh in their ſleeves to ſee ſo many good fames ſullied, and ſo little oppoſition to be made againſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">§. II. Nor hath the Parliament been awanting to take notice at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times of this inconvenience; witneſſe their many Votes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and appointing of Committees to this purpoſe, which as yet have effected nothing: For which, ſome have given theſe reaſons: Firſt, That no particular perſon of ſufficient abilities, armed with ſufficient authority, and encouraged by a competent Salary, hath been deputed to this employment; but the buſineſſe hanging on many ſhoulders, hath through careleſneſſe of the Superiours, the treachery and cunning of the Underlings (who are known to receive fees from the Hawkers and Printers for their connivance) fall'n to the ground. Another cauſe is given, That the Mercuries and Hawkers (ſo they call the men and women that carry theſe papers up and down) are grown into a kinde of a Corporation, and finding the ſweet of it, will not be deterred by theſe empty threats of Bedlam and Bridewell, for needy people are in a manner lawleſſe. A third cauſe is aſſigned, which indeed is the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from the truth, That a wrong courſe is taken to endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Libels in the hands of theſe people, when they ought to be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally ſuppreſt at the Preſſes; which till it be done, they take but the ſame courſe, as if a Phyſitian ſhould endeavour to remove an internall fixed Diſeaſe, by the cutting off of ſome outward member.</p>
            <p n="3">§. III. But the troth is this, and which till it be remedied, all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in this kind will be vain: the permiſſion of Bibles printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, and ſome others of the moſt ſaleable Books to be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vended, hath ſo diſcouraged the myſtery of Printing here, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37183:4"/> Printers are neceſſitated to undertakings of this nature, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hazardous, ſo they bring them in ſome little profit: and their Brethren knowing not how ſoon the caſe may be their own, out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt diſſemble it. This once remedied, there would not a Pamphlet peep out, but it would be track'd to its firſt riſe, and diſcovered: And I beleeve, this wholſome policy put in execution, would of it ſelf prove effectuall, without that tyrannicall paſſe-port of an <hi>Imprimatur;</hi> firſt ſpawned by the Inquiſition, foſtered by the Biſhops and their Trencher-chaplains, and at laſt catcht by the turbulent Presbyterians.</p>
            <p n="4">§. IIII. I muſt adde, as a branch of this cauſe, that although Printing be decayed, Printers are encreaſed, whereas the Preſſes were before of a ſet number, which muſt needs infer, there is danger in the multitude of them; whereas if they were limited as I ſaid before, there might ſcarce be a Ballad done, but it would be accompted for, and the State might be ſatisfied, if it were injured by a piece, without need, to curb it by a Licenſe; which commonly rather defaces good pieces (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the humour of the Licenſer) then expunges bad ones. We ſhall not at this time inſiſt any thing upon theſe excellent advantages, and horrible inconveniences, which may proceed from the good or bad managing of Printing, the wiſdome of any State, though never ſo weak will finde it out. But to the purpoſe, if this be beſide it.</p>
            <p n="5">§. V. Among the many Pamphlets that have infected our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal, two, in reſpect of their continuance and audacious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, have not been of the leaſt note, <hi>Pragmaticus</hi> and <hi>Elencticus;</hi> the former for a watry and ſleight kind of bitterneſſe, ſeaſoned for the moſt, with prophaned ſentences of holy writ, whoſe abuſe is all the ingenuity it can claim: The other (which occaſioned this preſent task) by a malicious ribauldry, and deſperate reviling of what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it pleaſed, and upon what grounds he cared not, which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo followed with a frontleſſe aſſertion of whatſoever might advance the cauſe he undertook, hath made it ſelf the companion of its friends, to ſee what a ſtout and daring champion they had got, and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of many of his enemies, to ſee how unjuſtly and frowardly he ſtruck at them.</p>
            <p n="6">§. VI. With theſe degrees hath this ſheet of paper, in deſpight of the obſcurity of its birth and Author, made it ſelf the <hi>cenſor</hi> of moſt of the actions and paſſages of the Kingdom; inſomuch, that having in late weeks foulely fallen on my Lord of <hi>Warwick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> Maſter <hi>Soliciter,</hi> Maſter <hi>Corbet,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Maſter <hi>Hall,</hi> Maſter <hi>Lilly,</hi> with others of leſſe note and quality; it ſtruck in it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37183:4"/> its thirtieth ſheet at the Parliament it ſelf, and with a raſcally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, endeavoured to make all the bitterneſſe that could be emptied againſt them, to ſerve as a foil to ſet of the King, whom it doth rather injure, by how much he layes to his charge thoſe vertues, which either are not found, or are awanting in him, and paints him with thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which any body that is not byaſſed, may ſee are adulterate, and belong not to him; ſo that on the one ſide, his diſpraiſes being ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilouſly libellous, and not to be beleeved, his <hi>encomions</hi> on the other ſide are meerly <hi>petitionary,</hi> and not to be granted by any one that hath the leaſt notice of the actions and carriage of this King.</p>
            <p n="7">§. VI. But becauſe a <hi>generall</hi> Anſwer is not enough to ſatisfie <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> inſtances, we will run over the Particulars, and ſee by what truth, nay diſcretion, they can be made good: yet muſt we profeſſe to retain all <hi>reverence</hi> to the King's perſon, whom we do not in the leaſt <hi>levell at,</hi> further then what may conduce to cleer the underſtanding of this preſent <hi>compariſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">§. VII. We ſhall onely premiſe, that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the carriage of a <hi>Government</hi> a long time <hi>ſetled,</hi> and <hi>rooted</hi> in the <hi>opinions</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> and one that is but <hi>new,</hi> and ariſes from a <hi>change:</hi> for mens <hi>expectations</hi> being in the later caſe <hi>raiſed,</hi> and not meeting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with equall ſatisfaction, preſently turn into <hi>diſaffection,</hi> whereas in a ſetled government, mens thoughts are at a ſtand; and though they <hi>meet</hi> with ſome <hi>inconveniences,</hi> they are rather willing to <hi>ſuffer</hi> them, then run the <hi>hazard</hi> of an <hi>inſurrection.</hi> To adde, that a Government of <hi>ſome ſtanding,</hi> hath commonly obſerved and remedied thoſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which a State of a leſſer ſtanding cannot, as either being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in other affairs, or elſe for the preſent not willing to note them: Withall in the former caſe, the Revenue is ſetled and certain, which is not ſo in the later, although there be much the more occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may cauſe ſome unuſuall <hi>levies,</hi> yet without the imputation of <hi>tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">§. IX. So that were it true what the <hi>Pamphleteer</hi> ſayes, that the people were <hi>weary of the oppreſſion and ſlavery, which</hi> (he ſays) <hi>they now groan under;</hi> it might be rather their own <hi>inconſideracies</hi> then the <hi>miſ-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> whom yet (as being but men, and walking in ſlippery times) I ſuppoſe no man is bound to <hi>juſtifie</hi> in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: yet for ſetting up any <hi>arbitrary</hi> or <hi>tyrannicall Government,</hi> the <hi>beſt</hi> of them would as much <hi>loath</hi> the <hi>thought</hi> of it, as the <hi>worſt</hi> would <hi>fear</hi> to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="10">§. X. But how do they oppoſe a <hi>gracious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>King?</hi> when all their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37183:5"/> endeavours have hitherto been to draw him from thoſe <hi>Counſellours,</hi> which by the confeſſion of his own party, have been too prevalent with him: and had we any leiſure to make long reflections on the late war, it were no difficulty to demonſtrate, that the <hi>ſtubbornneſſe</hi> and <hi>averſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Party,</hi> drew it out to that length, though the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> charges the <hi>People,</hi> that <hi>they embrace an unnaturall and bloody War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">§. XI. The people are alſo charged to abandon all Order <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall,</hi> as if taking away of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whoſe groſſe <hi>enormities</hi> became the <hi>outcry</hi> of the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> reduced us into an Anarchy, or the taking away of ſuperſtitious Ceremonies (not onely burdenſome to tender conſciences) innovated againſt Law, brought prophaneneſſe upon us, and ſhook the frame of all divine Worſhip: And whereas he ſayes, that <hi>no government can ſuit with this Nation but Monarchy:</hi> 'Tis granted, onely we deſire it may not be <hi>Muſcovitiſh</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh;</hi> and we now come to the <hi>Paralell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">§. XII. <hi>We know (and the deadlieſt enemies he hath have acknowledged) that his Majeſty conformeth himſelf unto the lawes of Nature, which theſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants (at their pleaſure) trample on.</hi> This fellow either not underſtood or explained not what he meant in that place by the lawes of Nature; nor can we, till we be as wiſe as he, make an anſwer to it: onely if he underſtand it as it is in the <hi>Schools,</hi> 'tis but a poor acknowledgment, every King having other Lawes whereby to govern. But why did he not inſtance wherein the <hi>Tyrants</hi> (as he cals them) did <hi>trample</hi> on them; for by <hi>generall</hi> criminations it is eaſie to overthrow the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
            <p n="13">§. XIII. <hi>The King reſpects Religion, Justice and Faith, whereas they regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, Faith nor Law.</hi> For the King's <hi>Religion,</hi> we refer it to that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who beſt knows it. For his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> whether all the acts of his reign fall under that note or no, may be ſoon enquired. For his <hi>Faith</hi> (which we muſt interpret to be keeping of promiſe) 'tis well enough known how <hi>contrary</hi> his <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> have been one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the Parliaments <hi>regarding of God,</hi> his mercies to them, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo continued, ſhew them not unſincere. For their regarding of <hi>Faith,</hi> tax them if thou canſt with any <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Promiſe.</hi> For their regard of <hi>Law,</hi> to what end have they fought ſo long? but to reſcue it from oppreſſion; and how can they not regard that whereof they are the makers? but indeed there is a <hi>height</hi> of <hi>malice</hi> in this <hi>expreſſion;</hi> and there can be no more ſaid againſt the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p n="14">§. XIIII. <hi>The King referreth all his actions to the good of the Common-wealth, and ſafety of his Subjects; whereas the other reſpect nothing more then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37183:5"/> their own particular profits, pleaſure and revenge.</hi> If the King referred all his actions, &amp;c. he were an <hi>Angel</hi> and no <hi>Man:</hi> But this is a meer hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall <hi>common place</hi> of <hi>flattery.</hi> For the other, &amp;c. That that there may be <hi>ſuch ayms</hi> among ſome <hi>particulars,</hi> we wiſh we could deny; but for the <hi>generall,</hi> 'tis an imputation that a deadly enemy would hardly charge them withall.</p>
            <p n="15">§. XV. <hi>The King always endeavoured to enrich his Subjects; whereas theſe Tyrants ſeek after nothing more, then by impoveriſhing of them, to encreaſe their own wealth.</hi> If the King had ſuch deſires to enrich his Subjects, how came thoſe unknown Taxes of Ship-money, Knighthood, Loan-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, &amp;c. Not to note a kind of covetouſneſſe in the King, unſuitable to ſo great a Prince; though to charge the Parliament with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhment, Prejudice it ſelf can hardly do it, although in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, it were to be wiſht there were occaſion of more juſt vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
            <p n="16">§. XVI. <hi>The King accounteth his own Goods to be the Goods of his people; they reckon not onely their goods, but even their bodies and their lives alſo their own.</hi> This is meer preſumption, as a particular inſiſtance on both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would cleer, in reflecting onely on the intentions of either Party.</p>
            <p n="17">§. XVII. <hi>The King ſeverely revenged the publick injuries done againſt the Kingdom, and eaſily pardon the wrongs done to himſelf; theſe men moſt cruelly revenge their own, and pardon what is done againſt others.</hi> For the King, the Iſle of <hi>Rhee</hi> buſineſſe, with that of <hi>Rochel,</hi> is not forgotten: and how ſenſible he is of particular injuries, they that know his diſpoſition can beſt tell: nay, it is affirmed by ſome of his own Party, that the letting fall of ſome ſharp ſpeeches hath cauſed not a few to appear againſt him (as for example, he told <hi>Pembrook</hi> he was too long by the head, &amp;c.) whereas all the Kingdom may know how mercifull the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been to them whom they overcome; and let any indifferent man judge, whether ſuch quarter would have been had, had the other ſide prevailed; nay, whether they have not ſuffered by their too much ſlackneſſe.</p>
            <p n="18">§. XVIII. <hi>The King willingly would forgive the offences of other men, but is of his own failings a ſevere Judge; wheras theſe bloody villains ſharply revenge even the leaſt offences of others, but unto themſelves are moſt favourable.</hi> This is in effect what was ſpoken of in the laſt Paragraph; yet has not the King been noted as any ſuch ſevere Judge of himſelf, but rather of a ſtiffe nature, why complies he not elſe with the Parliament, while they by their ſeverall contrary Votes, ſhew they are unvvilling to ſtand to that long, vvhich they ſuppoſe not ſo convenient. And for their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37183:6"/> of Pamphlets (as <hi>Elencticus</hi> complains) let him ſpeak if ever he knew one State in love with them: The truth is, they connive at them too much.</p>
            <p n="19">§. XIX. <hi>The King alwayes endeavoured to maintain his Subjects in Peace and unity; whereas they ſtrive ſtill to ſet them at oddes, and by that means to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine one another, and with the confiſcation of their Land, Goods, enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> If it be ſo, why did the King deſert the Parliament, and never yet return to it; and how much are they to blame when the frequent inſurrections of the other Party, have ſet the Kingdom in a flame.</p>
            <p n="20">§. XX. <hi>The King advanced to the higheſt degree of honour the beſt and moſt vertuous men; but theſe men promote the greateſt theeves and villains, whom they uſe as ſpunges to ſuck the wealth of the people.</hi> If the King advanced none but the beſt men, how came ſuch a contamination of the Nobility? the King advanced many who ſince have adhered to the Common-wealth; either this aſſertion is falſe, or the men are good ſtill: did all at Court enter the Temple of Honour through that of Vertue? you that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thoſe times, call back your thoughts a little, &amp;c. Are they all bad the Parliament employes? or are they employed to that purpoſe? it cannot be denied, but that ſome have been faithfull to their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and muſt paſſe to Poſterity, with the character of Honeſty.</p>
            <p n="21">§. XXI. <hi>The King frankly beſtowed the greateſt and moſt gainfull Offices of the State upon men of beſt deſerts, who free from bribery and corruption, might defend the people from all injury and oppreſſion; whereas theſe Rebels ſet them to ſale to thoſe that will give moſt for them, and by their robberies and unreaſonable exactions, keep the people under.</hi> Was bribery unknown at Court (far be it from me to charge the perſon of the King) or were all men that were advanced <hi>ſeraphicall?</hi> was there not ſeverall and horrid corruptions? elſe, why were ſo many impeached and diſcharged of their Offices the very beginning of the Parliament? But can you charge the people with ſetting to ſale any one Office, but rather diſpoſed them into thoſe hands who have been moſt active and conſtant in the Cauſe of the Common-wealth, which now groans as little under injuſtice as ever it did, ſay the adverſary what he will.</p>
            <p n="22">§. XXII. <hi>The King was ever ready to expoſe his Life to any hazard for the good of his Subjects; they durſt never ſtir their Arſes in their defence, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it a duty to periſh for them in their unjuſt quarrels.</hi> Inſtance us one eminent hazard and adventure of the King; the moſt of them (we know) had Military Commands and Offices, which they valiantly and faithfully executed from the beginning of the War, till a particular Ordinance proclaimed them, and ordered their ſervices to <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37183:6"/>
            <p n="23">§. XXIII. <hi>The King (notwithstanding all the malice and venome of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and detracting tongues &amp; pens) is ſtill beloved &amp; honoured of his Subjects; theſe envious tyrants hate them all, and are reciprocally of them hated.</hi> There is no body that as a Subject does not honour and love the King, yea hate them that any way unjuſtly aſperſe him; but if a malignant humour prevail in the Kingdom againſt the two Houſes, that may be the fault of the people themſelves, and not theirs; for if they hated the people, they had never done ſo much as they have done, and ſuffered for them.</p>
            <p n="24">§. XXIIII. <hi>The King in time of War had no other recourſe but to his own loyall Subjects; when they have no other War then againſt them.</hi> How came it then that he had ſuch aſſiſtances came over from <hi>Holland,</hi> and other places, to fight againſt his Subjects? why hath there been ſuch ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of forreign Princes? and why was there a peace made in <hi>Ireland</hi> and Rebels brought over? while the Parliament held off their hands from any ſuch engagements, and were deſirous (if it had been poſſible) not to have made uſe of the aſſiſtance of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe coming in notwithſtanding brought thoſe undue aſperſions upon them, of calling in forreign Force: but this was without reaſon as I have made it good in ſundry other places; which whoſo pleaſeth may read.</p>
            <p n="25">§. XXV. <hi>The King had neither Garriſon nor Guards but thoſe of his own houſhold; whereas they dare not ſhew their brazen faces without Garriſons and Guards, and Armies of the moſt diſſolute and deſperate Villains that the whole Kingdom affords, to protect them in their tyranny, and to keep the poor Subject in a continuall ſlavery.</hi> What Garriſons or Army were needfull for the King in time of peace, when all the Kingdom was under his onely beck, and all the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom in hands of his own? when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were in a manner compelled to take in what they had by the dint of the ſword; which if they ſhould lay down (there being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny drawn every day about them) were meer folly and ſtupidity in them: but that which gals them moſt, is the keeping up of the Army, the next means under God of their ſafety, they being ſuch as had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore got them the beſt Victories, yes, more then all their other Armies beſides, that ſo ſuddenly to diſperſe them in the midſt of ſo much need they could not have been excuſed from a breach of truſt, which lyes, upon them from the Kingdom. But how deſperate and diſſolute villains are the Army? hath it not been confeſſed of them, that they kept as good order and civility as any have been known in the laſt Wars? what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages can they be taxed with at <hi>Whitehall?</hi> or whether doth the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man cry more out of them then the <hi>Cavalieriſh</hi> Army? but if you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37183:7"/> take deſperate in ſuch a ſenſe, as to undergo any hazard or any danger, when they are directed by their Commanders, 'tis granted they are deſperate, and that they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured as much as could be required from men and Souldiers; and theſe ſufferings hath been requited with as many Victories.</p>
            <p n="26">§. XXVI. <hi>The King lives ſecurely in all quiet and tranquility of mind, for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe weekly in their ordinary Pamphlets, he is merry and pleaſant (notwithstanding his cloſe impriſonment, and moſt barbarous uſage;) whileſt theſe traytors are poſſeſſed and troubled with carefull and contrary thoughts, ſtill languiſhing in a perpetuall horrour and fear, and gnawed to pieces by the worm of their bad conſciences.</hi> If the King be in that quiet and tranquility, he may enjoy it, there is none envies it to him: But if you have no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er authority for it then printed Pamphlets, we will not ſo eaſily beleeve it; there is none will ſcripturize them no more then they will the ungodly Pamphlets of your Party: yet let us know, what barbarours uſage is that he is under, or wherein he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly dealt with; Happly he may be a little reſtrained, but that is onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the acceſſe of bad Counſell to him, and other inconveniences that might dog ſuch a freedom: But wherein hath the Parliament dealt unmercifully with him, when their care and proviſion for him is ſo well known? And how is the Parliament gnawed with fear and horrour of a bad conſcience? Verily for confutation of this, 'tis enough to ſay it came from <hi>Elencticus;</hi> for what other pen could inhumanely charge ſuch deſperation and horrour of conſcience on ſo many ſelect and worthy Patriots:</p>
            <p n="27">§. XXVII. <hi>The King is aſſured of a moſt bleſſed and eternall life in heaven; the other ſtill expecting when they ſhall be ſwallowed up among the damned in hell.</hi> There are not a few of the King's Party that deny any particular aſſurance can be had of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether himſelf do or no, 'tis better known to him then <hi>Elencticus,</hi> who it ſeems hath been his <hi>Confeſſour,</hi> he is ſo well acquainted with him. But by what inſpiration had he it, that the Parliament expected to be all damned; for firſt, many are damned whoſe conſciences are ſo ſeared, that they cannot be ſenſible of it; next, them that are terrified with damnation, and do not endeavour to lay hold on God's mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, offend in that the moſt of all; ſo did <hi>Cain,</hi> when he ſaid, his ſin would not be forgiven; thirdly, are there any ſuch horrible ſins to anſwer for? and fourthly, doth this impudent wretch know, but, if they were as baſe devils as ever were incarnate, God might give them a time of mercy before they dye; I am aſhamed to inſiſt on ſuch baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of a Chriſtian pen.</p>
            <p n="28">§. XXVIII. <hi>The King hath the immortall God Author of all his actions; they have the Devil for preſident in all their conſultations and councels.</hi> If God be ſo the author of his actions, he would have ſhewed ſome more viſible mercies upon him, and will do, if the others be ſo diabolicall, as the Libell ſayes they are; for none muſt expect to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per but the friends and ſervants of God.</p>
            <p n="29">§. XXIX And becauſe the miſconceit of the Parliaments doings, and the ſmall ſatisfaction is to be had among the generality about the true ends and uſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall for thy better ſatisfaction (O Chriſtian Reader) ſet down our thoughts concerning Government, and communicate them unto thee; in which Diſcourſe (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the impertinencies commonly uſed in Controverſies) we ſhall obſerve this method: firſt, we ſhall conſider the ends of Government: ſecondly, the ſeverall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments themſelves: thirdly, the right that people have to their Government: fourthly, how far we can perceive by Scripture light, that God entruſts every people with the right of Government: laſtly, we ſhall ſay ſomewhat about change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and upon what means and grounds it is to be admitted. And in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance we ſhall neither be negligent nor ſlack, if we ſhall perceive this weak Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to be gratefull unto thee; and the eternall Wiſdom be pleaſed to make our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as ſuccesfull as they are honeſt.</p>
